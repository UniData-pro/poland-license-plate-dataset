# License Plate Recognition Dataset
Dataset contains **196 664** photos of license plates, providing a comprehensive resource for **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), **plate recognition**, and **vehicle registration** analysis. Each image file is paired with a CSV file containing license plate text for use in OCR, plate recognition, and **characters recognition tasks**. 

By leveraging this dataset, researchers can explore **traffic patterns**, improve **traffic management**, and train learning models for autonomous vehicles. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/poland-license-plate-detection-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=poland-license-plate-dataset)**

The dataset includes a CSV file mapping image file names to corresponding plate text and country labels. Photos represent various road types, road segments, and traffic scenarios, offering a diverse foundation for training and processing OCR systems.
